## Weighted inputs (synapses) and bias:

with each input --> weight is associated.\
This weight is for channels transferred from input layer to next layer\
Weight increases the steepness of activation function

with each hidden layer nueron ---> a bias is assoiciated\
bias helps in controlling the value at which the activation function will trigger.

The processing done by a neuron is thus denoted as :\
**output  =  sum (weights * inputs) + bias**
