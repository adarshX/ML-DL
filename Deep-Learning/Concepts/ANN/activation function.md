### Activation function:

Non-linear complex functional mappings between the inputs and response variable.

This is just a mapping.  ----> Their main purpose is to convert a input signal of a node in a A-NN to an output signal. 

A Neural Network without Activation function would simply be a Linear regression Model, which has limited power

Real-life data like images , speech are complicated non-linear data ----> so we need non linear function   to make our network  learn from this data 


The wiehted sum + bias  of each nueron(calculated as above) is substituted in activation function and get a value ---> this value is ouput of that nueron which acts as input for next layer.


Example : sigmoid function --- > f(x) = 1 / 1 + exp(-x)

Conclusion:  \
**need to apply an activation function f(x) --->  to make  network more powerful and  learn from complex data  --->  represent non-linear complex  mappings between inputs and outputs**
